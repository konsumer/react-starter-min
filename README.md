# Simple react starter

This is the bare minimum to get a hot-reloading express-based ES6 React project going, in the style that I use.

* `npm i` - install dependencies an build tools
* `npm start` - start webserver
* `npm run build` - build files in `pub/` for deployment

You can set the environment variable `NODE_ENV=production` to get a 1-time optimized build and disable hot-reloading (for production deployment.)
